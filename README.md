# Core_Java-Space-Weight-Convert-Calculation
Create a program that will ask you for your current weight.
The program should then give you a list of planets and numbers that you can use to select them.
The program will then ask you for which planet you're selecting.
Then, the program will multiply your current weight by the relative gravity of that planet.
Finally, the program will output your relative weight on that planet (gravity * weight)

The relative gravities and numbers of each planet are as follows:
1 (Venus) -> 0.78
2 (Mars) -> 0.39
3 (Jupiter) -> 2.65
4 (Saturn) -> 1.17
5 (Uranus) -> 1.05
6 (Neptune) -> 1.23

Your output could be the following:
Please enter your current earth weight: 
>128
